   You can also pick anyone NOT on these lists as long as they have real credits in both worlds.

3. Provide the name exactly as it appears on TMDB (for person search) and on Discogs (for artist search). If the person uses different names in each world (e.g., "Donald Glover" on TMDB but "Childish Gambino" on Discogs), provide BOTH names separately. IMPORTANT: Many artists use a single name on Discogs (e.g., "Tyrese" not "Tyrese Gibson", "Beyonce" not "Beyonce Knowles", "Aaliyah" not "Aaliyah Haughton", "Rihanna" not "Robyn Fenty"). Use the name fans would actually search for on each platform.
4. Include an "alternateNames" array listing ALL names this person is known by — stage names, birth names, band names, aliases. Example: for Donald Glover, include ["Donald Glover", "Childish Gambino"]. For Yasiin Bey, include ["Mos Def", "Yasiin Bey"]. For Bruce Willis, include ["Bruce Willis", "Bruno"]. This helps us find them on different databases.
5. Write a 2-3 sentence narrative about their crossover journey — interesting, specific, not generic. Focus on what makes their dual career surprising or noteworthy.
6. Write a single surprising "did you know?" fact about their dual career.
7. Classify their direction: "music-to-film" (started in music, moved to acting), "film-to-music" (started in acting, moved to music), or "simultaneous" (did both from early career).
8. If you know the TMDB person ID or Discogs artist ID, include them. Otherwise leave those fields out.
9. Provide a "creditTrivia" array with 5-8 short, surprising trivia facts about their most notable films, TV shows, and albums. Each entry has a "title" (the movie/show/album name, matching how it appears on TMDB or Discogs) and a "fact" (a single sentence, max 15 words, genuinely surprising). Focus on behind-the-scenes stories, record-breaking stats, unexpected connections, or fun production details.
